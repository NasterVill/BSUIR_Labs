# LightningPaint
This project is my implementation of Paint application for PC's, which was made with the help of Qt framework.

This particular paint has some extra features, comparing to is's alternatives: it can filtrate images, in order to
supress all the noises in the given image (median filtration). Also it can change the brightness of a picture, with the help
of gamma correction procedure.

There is still work to do, to turn this paint into a high-grade application, but
even now it's abilities are good enough for a simple Paint implementation.
