# LightningTuner
An Android tuner application, which was a topic of a coursework for system software.

The main goal of this project was to write a simple Android tuner aplication
plus to study the topic of Fast Fourier transform algorithms.

For this project I chose a Cooley-Tukey iterative algorithm. Even though FFT brings some troubles
like "missing fundamental" problem, the accuracy and speed are quite good, and the FFT itself seemed 
to be a good subtopic for a coursework.
