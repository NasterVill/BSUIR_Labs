# First pair: Chadovich V. and Lapotko E.

## Style: Driver-Navigator

### Developed:
Data access level (back end)
### What we liked:
* clear division of duties allowed us to solve the problem faster and more efficiently.
### What did not like:
* driver training architectural solution navigator.
### Conclusion:
This method is effective when the developer-navigator is better versed in the architecture of the application and can share this experience with the developer who has been working with the project not so long ago.

# Second pair: Chadovich V. and Zakharchenia V.

## Style: Master-Slave

### Developed:
Sorting events by location (back end)
### What we liked:
* less experienced developer got deeper knowledge in the development of this task.
### What did not like:
* the performance of one task requires the strength of two developers.
### Conclusion:
This method is effective when training a developer who does not have enough experience or knowledge to solve the problem independently.


# Third pair: Protasenya V. and Pankov V.

## Style: Ping-Pong

### Developed:
Application testing (mobile client)
### What we liked:
* as a result of this work, code is obtained that is resistant to pseudo-enhancements. The probability of making mistakes when writing code is reduced due to already written tests.
### What did not like:
* testing is not as interesting as the development, the error in the spelling of the test leads to disastrous consequences for both developers.
### Conclusions:
This method is effective when working in a pair of developer-testers and when there are serious requirements for testing, and this task is solved by the efforts of at least one developer
