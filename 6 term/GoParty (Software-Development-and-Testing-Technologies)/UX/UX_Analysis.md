## UX Improvements

When the user opens the application he can see a login screen with unambiguous logo, telling him that application is somehow connected to public activities. When he logges in the first screen he will see is a screen with list of events, which will instantly tell him about the application main goal -- to manage public events.

All the components and their functions are easy to recognize because of their convinient and understandable layout, their icons correspond to the actions they trigger. All main entities like events and users have a picture, attached to them, so it is not difficult to to find them on the smartphone's screen.

All the screens are easily reachable, the are logically connected and all represent the homogeneuos block of functions which user can work with. Navigation buttons do not disturb user and have understandable icons with them.

The application is designed with bright butl calm colors like white and blue which do not distract user from the intaraction with it. Application. All the elements are correcctly aligned and there are no excessively big elements. Events and profiles have dedicated space for pictures to make UX more pleasent by showing not only raw inforamation text but also different images which bring diversion to the process of application usage.

Application hasn't got any age restrictions which makes it target audience quite large. Application is adapted well to Android platform and will run smoothly on any device with API 24+.
